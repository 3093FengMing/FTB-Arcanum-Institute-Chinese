After the witch was successfully resealed inside the Arena, peace once again blanketed the hallowed halls of the Arcanum Institute. 

The air was filled with a serene aura as the students and faculty celebrated their hard-fought victory, and the threat that had loomed over their magical world was vanquished.

As the days turned into weeks, the institute blossomed with renewed life. Students delved deeper into their studies, uncovering the secrets of ancient tomes and perfecting their magical abilities.

The gardens flourished with vibrant, mystical plants, and the enchanting melodies of magical creatures filled the air.

One sunny afternoon, a grand assembly was held in the courtyard, where the Headmaster addressed the entire student body.

He spoke of the strength, unity, and resilience displayed by the students during the darkest hours and commended their bravery in standing against the witch's malevolence.

The heroes of this tale, those who had risked their lives to defeat the malicious witch, were awarded with medals of honor and stood proudly before their peers. It was a moment of triumph and recognition, and their faces beamed with pride.

The students of Arcanum Institute continued their studies, honing their magical talents, and exploring the limitless possibilities of their enchanting world.

New friendships were forged, knowledge was shared, and the legacy of the witch's defeat became an enduring source of inspiration for all.

And so, the Arcanum Institute flourished, a beacon of magical learning and harmony, where students continued to write their own chapters in the never-ending saga of wonder, discovery, and enchantment.

The memory of the witch's malevolence would forever serve as a reminder of the strength, that lies within the bonds of friendship and the power of magic to overcome any darkness.
